# Webscrapping with Python
This repository is made for Project 1 of the discipline Collection, Preparation, and Data
Analysis on Pontifical Catholic University of Rio Grande do Sul.

It consists of two activities of webscrapping: one in a desktop application - the
'paises.ipynb'-, and one in a real environment - 'imdb.ipynb' file.

## Instructions
- ### For IMDB notebook:
This notebook executes a webscrapping routine on IMDB movie reviewing website. It runs on Selenium
extension for Python and your kernel needs to have it installed. For some operational systems, the
webdriver doesn't support running Chrome, so it is possible that it would be needed to change it to
firefox.

A part of the code searches through the page by strings, so the website needs to be on English
